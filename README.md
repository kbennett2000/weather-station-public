# weather-station

## Description:
This project consists of one to many weather sensors based on an ESP32 control board running FreeRTOS and several cheap off-the-shelf sensors. Readings from the weather sensors are collected by a light computing device (Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W or Linux PC) and displayed on the local network as well as recorded in a MySQL database to be used for forecasting functions.

## Instructions:
- Pin connections for the ESP32 based sensors can be found below.
- Detailed setup instructions for Raspberry Pi [can be found here](docs/rpiSetup.md)
- Detailed setup instructions for Linux PC [can be found here](docs/ubuntuServerSetup.md)
- Be sure to change the `NetworkName` and `NetworkPassword` palceholders in [the Indoor sketch](sketches/jonesBigAssWeatherStation_FreeRTOS_indoor_main.ino) and [the Outdoor sketch](sketches/jonesBigAssWeatherStation_FreeRTOS_outdoor.ino) to match your network.
